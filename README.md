# change_wp
Small rust executable coded in 10 mins to engadge chaos in my school changin wallepapers on computers to random shit.
You probably asking why to code a program to change wallepaper?
- Practice with rust.
- Practice with winapi. (Yes it won't work on your fucking Linux or MacOS. It made specificaly for my school computers (They are still using windows 7 ðŸ˜’))
- Group policy for my school made so you cant change wallepapers nor open control panel. This was the fastest and easiest bypass to make.


## Instalation:
Bruh, just download portable executable from releases.

## Usage:
```
.\changewp.exe <path_to_image>
```
