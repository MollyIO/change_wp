# change_wp
A tiny Rust executable coded in 10 minutes to engage chaos in my school by changing wallpapers on computers to random shit.  

You’re probably asking: *“Why code a program just to change wallpapers?”*
- **Practice with Rust** 🦀  
- **Practice with WinAPI** 🪟
- **Bypass school restrictions**: Group policy prevents changing wallpapers or opening Control Panel. This was the fastest and easiest way I discovered.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project uses **WinAPI**. Yeah, it won’t work on fucking Linux or MacOS. Made specifically for my school computers (still using Windows 7 on Intel Pentium in mid 2025 bru 🙏). **Cope 😘**

## Installation:
Bruh, just download the portable executable from releases.  

## Usage:
```powershell
.\changewp.exe <path_to_image>
```
